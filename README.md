# Mailtasker
I am quite new to Github and Python as a whole. This is my first project.
Create a automailer that will pull news from Business Insider and send it at a specified time

I am using the following libraries
MIMEMultipart 
SMTPLIB
Requests
Schedule
Time
BeautifulSoup

Once I get it to work I will create a front-end or maybe link it to a website. Still not sure on all the details but we will go as we learn. I just had to start somewhere. 

Any feedback is welcome.
